# How can I contribute?

## Improve documentation
As a `Fable Maker` user, you are the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation: typo corrections, clarifications, more examples, etc. Take a look at the documentation issues that need help.
Please follow the Documentation guidelines.

## Give feedback on issues
Some issues are created without information requested in the Bug report guideline. Help make them easier to resolve by adding any relevant information.
Issues with the [design label]n) are meant to discuss the implementation of new features. Participating in the discussion is a good opportunity to get involved and influence the future direction of `Fable Maker`.

## Fix bugs and implement features
Confirmed bugs and ready-to-implement features are marked with the help wanted label. Post a comment on an issue to indicate you would like to work on it and to request help from the `Fable Maker` maintainers and the community.

## Using the issue tracker
The issue tracker is the channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting merge requests only.
Before opening an issue or a Merge Request, please use the Gitlab issue search to make sure the bug or feature request hasn't been already reported or fixed.

## Bug report
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report and fill the information requested in the Bug report template.

## Feature request
Feature requests are welcome, but take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible and fill the information requested in the Feature request template.

## Submitting a Merge Request
Good merge requests, whether patches, improvements, or new features, are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.
Please ask first before embarking on any significant merge requests (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
If you have never created a merge request before, welcome ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ˜„. Here is a great tutorial on how to send one :)
Here is a summary of the steps to follow:

### Set up the workspace
If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream and update dependencies:

```sh
git checkout main
```

```sh
git pull upstream main
```


Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:


```sh
git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

Make your code changes, following the Coding rules

Push your topic branch up to your fork:

```sh
git push origin <topic-branch-name>
```

Open a Merge Request with a clear title and description.
